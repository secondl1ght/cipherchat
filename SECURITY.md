## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report all issues to [cipherchat@protonmail.com](mailto:cipherchat@protonmail.com) and I will get back to you as soon as possible. If a legitimate vulnerability is found that requires fixing, some sats may be sent in return. Keeping in mind this is an open source project without funding. If you could include suggested actions to patch the problem that would also be helpful. Thanks.
